We are thrilled to welcome Ashley Shaw to the lab as a postdoc. Ashley comes to us after completing a PhD with Diana Wall studying soil communities in Antarctica. She'll be taking on our new USDA project testing the effect of soil amendments in California rangelands on multiple ecosystem services. Welcome Ashley!
