Congratulations to Elizabeth Baach and Hunter Mackin for defending their theses. Elizabeth's project focused on litter quality between native and non-native plants on and off ant mounds in a California serpentine grassland - take a look at what she found in her poster below - and Hunter's project looked at how maternal environments and pathogens affect germination in two common Pacific Northwest grasses. Also check out an update on Cal Penkauskas's research using pig grazing to reduce filbertworm infestation in hazelnuts in his poster below as well as [**this article**](https://around.uoregon.edu/content/biology-major-recruits-hogs-help-hazelnuts) in Around the O. Justin Day presented a poster on his summer research that examined the effects of compost and precipitation on arbuscular mycorrhizal associations with plants - check it out below - and congratulations to Justin for being accepted to the UOTeach master's program. And a big welcome to Sofi Forsman and Michaela Fishback, who will be working on phenology and trait measurements in Eliza Hernandez's ongoing greenhouse experiment.
