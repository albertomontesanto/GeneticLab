#### April 2018
We had a great California field season this year. Richard Hobbs celebrated his 36th year of sampling at Jasper Ridge, Dana Chadwick came out to help us sample, and we caught up with Joan Dudney, Stu Weiss, Lisy Torregrosa, Hal Mooney, Paul and Anner Ehrlich and Val Eviner. Loralee Larios and Lauren celebrated 6 years of Vasco sampling. Alejandro came out to help at Vasco, and then Lina joined us at SFREC. A productive and enjoyable April!
