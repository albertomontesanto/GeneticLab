We are so proud of our graduating seniors! We had a great showing at the Undergraduate Research Symposium, with **Cal** presenting a talk on hogs and hazelnuts, **Justin** presenting a poster on mycorrhizal fungi in rangelands, and **Michaela** a poster on N deposition in the serpentine. Plus **Marissa** gave an excellent finishing talk on cover crops in hazelnuts. Sad we couldn't say goodbye in person.

Lucky for us **Cal** will be continuing his research this summer on a [Peter O'Day Fellowship](https://urop.uoregon.edu/oday-fellowship/) with **Alejandro** and helping as lab manager into the fall. 

Plus the undergrads ran the table with UO UROP mini-grants this year, with successful proposal from **Justin**, **Anna**, **Marissa** and **Michaela**; **Marissa** and **Justin** also received UnderGrEBES grants.
