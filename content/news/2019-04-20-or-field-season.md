#### September 2019

It was a busy first year of Oregon fieldwork. Alejandro kicked it off last fall with his burn and seed additions to test strategies to restore invaded perennial grasslands. His "burn box" generated a lot of buzz amongst local fire crews. Spring sampling showed an initial positive effect on seedling establishment. His next experiment is now in the ground, assessing annual-perennial competition under heat. Meanwhile, Lina made the Great Basin her home last spring in large-scale seed and trait collection survey to test climate adaptation, and her rainout shelters for a common garden experiment are now in the ground in Eastern Oregon.
